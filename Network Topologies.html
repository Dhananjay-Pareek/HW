        The arrangement (also called layout) of nodes in a network is called network topology.
        There are broadly two types of topologies
        In broadcast topology, all nodes share the same physical link. When one node
        transmits, all nodes receive.
        simultaneously transmits, and there is a collision resolution mechanism for handling it.
        Broadcast topologies are mainly bus and ring. In point to point topology, every pair of
        nodes has a dedicated link.
    </p>

        <li id="li">Bus Topology</li>
        <img class="t-img" src="img/bus.png" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            In bus topology, there is a long cable, called backbone cable (or simply backbone), tha
            connects various nodes through a connector called tap In this,
            a message sent by one is received by all devices connected to backbone cable. This
            topology requires less cabling and is easy to install and extend the network laid u
            however, fault detection and isolation is difficult.
        </p>
        <li id="li"> Ring Topology</li>
        <p class="p">
            <img class="t-img" src="img/Ring.png" alt="">
            In ring topology, all the devices are attached through a cable in the form of ring. The message to be
            communicated is transmitted in one direction,
            thereby, relaying the message to the intended recipient. addition and deletion of
            devices, and fault detection and isolation is easy. However, the topology suffers from
            the limitation of single point failure leading to disruption of the entire network. sending a
            message from one node to another node may take more time.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Star Topology</li>
        <p class="p">
            <img class="t-img" src="img/star.jpg" alt="">
            In star topology, all the devices are connected to the central controller called hub communication between
            any two devices takes place through the
            hub responsible for relaying messages.
            configured. Also, fault detection and isolation is easy. However, it requires more cabling
            as compared to bus and ring topology. Also, hub failure will lead to network failure
        </p>
        <li id="li">Mesh Topology</li>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="img/mesh.jfif" alt="" class="t-img">
            In mesh topology, every node is connected with every other node in the network Because of dedicated point to
            point connection between every
            possible pair of nodes, the topology provides secure data t
            problem. it requires a large number of connections to establish the topology. This leads
            to difficulty in installation as the number of nodes grow as the network grows.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Tree Topology</li>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="img/TreeTopology.png" alt="" class="t-img">
            tree topology is a hybrid topology using a combination of star and bus topology.
            Backbone cable in a bus topology acts like the stem of the tree, and star networks (and
            even individual nodes) are connected to the main
            tree as shown in Figure 1.14 damage to a segment of a network laid using tree topology
            will not affect other segments.installation and configuration is difficult as compared to
            other topologies. also, if the backbone cab
            communication is disrupted
