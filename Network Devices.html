        Creation of a network requires various network Devices ,each of which plays a specific
        role in the network.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li id="li">Repeater</li><img src="img/repeater.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%;float: left;">
        <p class="p" style="margin-top: 7%;">
            With increase in distance, a signal may become weak and distorted.A repeater is used to restore the input
            signal to its original form, so that it can travel a large distance.Thus, it is placed between two cable
            segments. It is also known as digital regenerator which reshapes and amplifies the digital signal.
        </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <li id="li">Hub</li><img src="img/hub.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px;float: left;">
        <p class="p" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            Unlike a repeater which connects two cables, a hub connects several lines, also called,
            cable segments. A hub comprises several input/output(I/O) ports, each of which connects to a single cable
            Data arriving on an incoming line is output to alllines except the line on which the hub receives the data.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <li id="li">Bridge</li><img src="img/bridge.jpg" alt="" style="float: right;width: 20%;margin-right: 50px;">
        <p class="p">
            A bridge is a multiport device used for connecting two or more local area networks (LAN), possibly operating
            at different speeds .Thus, a bridge may be used to produce bigger LAN by combining smaller LANs. A bridge
            enables devices on one LAN segment to communicate with the devices on another LAN segment. Unlike hubs, they
            are intelligent devices which exercise discretion while forwarding data to the outgoing line leading to the
            destination.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Switch
        </li><img src="img/switch.png" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            Unlike bridges which connect two or more LAN segments ,switches are used to connect individual nodes in the
            network with each other. Each node within network is connected to a unique port in the switch On receiving
            the incoming data rame, it forwards it to only a single line connecting to the destination node. All the
            nodes connected through switch forms only one LAN.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Router</li><img src="img/router.jfif" alt="" style="float: left;">
        <p class="p">
            Routers are used for connecting various networks (LAN or WAN) with each other A router transmits data from
            an incoming network to another network. A route maintains a routing table of various networks. Based on the
            destination address, the router determines to which network the incoming packet should be
            transmitted.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <li id="li">Gateway</li><img src="img/gateway.png" alt="" style="width: 40%;">
        <p class="p">
            A gateway connects networks based on different protocol technologies to communicate with each other Data
            coming from one network operating on one protocol is converted according to the protocol of the outgoing
            network, and then forwarded. Thus a gateway may be thought of as a router equipped with software for
            protocol conversion.

        <li id="li">RJ-45</li><img src="img/rj-45.webp" alt="" style="width: 10%;float: right;">
        <p class="p">
            RJ-45 , short form of Registered Jack - 45 , is an eight wired connector that is used to connect computers
            on a local area network(LAN), especially Ethernet. RJ-45 connectors look similar to the RJ-11 connector used
            for connecting telephone
            equipment, but they are somewhat wider.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Wi-Fi Card</li><img src="img/wifi-card.jpg" style="float: left;height: 10%;width: 10%;" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            Wi-Fi cards are small and portable cards that allow your desktop or laptop computer to
            connect to the internet through a wireless network. Wi-Fi transmission is through the
            use of radio waves. The antenna transmits the radio signals and these signals are
            picked up by Wi-Fi receivers such as computers and cell phones equipped with Wi-Fi
            cards. These devices have to be within the range of a Wi-Fi network to receive the
            signals. The Wi-Fi card then reads the signals and produces a wireless internet
            connection. Many newer computers, mobile devices etc. are equipped with wireless
            networking capability and do not require a Wi-Fi card.
