    <h1 class="h1">Web Architecture</h1>
    <h2 class="h2"></h2>
    <p class="p">
        Web Architecture can be defined as the conceptual structure of the internet. The WWW
        or internet is a constantly changing medium that enables communication between
        different users and the technical interaction between different systems and
        subsystems. The infrastructure of the internet is made of three core components of data
        transmission protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS), representation formats (HTML, CSS,
        XML), and addressing standards (URI, URL).
        Origin of web architecture
        The world wide web is a concept that was realized in the 1990s so that people and
        machines could communicate with each other within a certain space. It is used to
        exchange, distribute, and share information in a network. At that time, the web
        consisted predominantly of static websites based on HTML, in other words, hypertexts
        that can be retrieved by a browser. Dynamic websites and distributed web services
        were added later
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2">Types of web architectures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li id="li">Client-server model
        </li>
        <p class="p">
            Initially, the web consisted of a two-tiered architecture: clients and servers. Clients and
            servers shared the tasks and services that the system was supposed to perform. For
            example, the client may request a service from the server; the server answers the
            request by providing the service. Retrieving a website using a URL address that directs
            a server to load the site in the client’s browser is an example of the two-layer model,
            also known as the client-server model. <br> The internet protocol family, which now consists of around 500
            different network
            protocols, is usually used as the basis for the WWW, but it usually comprises the
            TCP/TCP/IP reference model. Three prerequisites must exist in the web architecture for
            the application systems to communicate with one another:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li id="li">
                <p class="p">Representation formats with a fixed standard: The most frequently used formats
                    are HTML(HyperText Mark Up Language) , CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) or XML
                    (Extensible Mark up Language )when machines communicate with one another.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="li">
                <p class="p">Protocols for data transfer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS
                    (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is used in the web. Other applications, such
                    as mail servers, use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) or POP (Post Office
                    Protocol). </p>
            </li>
            <li id="li">
                <p class="p">The standard for addressing: This refers to the URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
                    which is an instance of the more general concept of URI.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
            Finally, the web architecture is the operational structure of application systems for data
            storage, data transmission, and presentation. When transferred to the web, the web
            architecture typically consists of database servers that manage the data and resources.
            They communicate with a client using a transfer protocol that can retrieve the data and
            view it in a browser. The representation is usually done with HTML and CSS.

        </p>
        <li id="li">Three-tier model </li>
        <p class="p">
            Three-tier models include an application logic between the client and the server, which
            handles the data processing and allows a certain degree of interaction. For example, an
            application server can process data while a database server is dedicated solely to data
            storage. In this way, content can be dynamically loaded and saved. The script language
            JavaScript is often responsible for the behavior of the client. <br> <br>
            Generally, a distinction is made between server-side and client-side data processing.
            Dynamic websites are characterized by the fact that content is changed on the client
            side. On the server side, modified content is stored via the application server on the
            database server. Optionally, this can be a virtual server that emulates a physical one. <br><br>
            There are different programming languages and frameworks to implement three-tier
            models like :- <br>
        <ul>
            <li id="li">Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)</li>
            <li id="li"> Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</li>
            <li id="li">JavaServer Pages (JSP)</li>
            <li id="li">Active Server Pages (ASP.NET)</li>
            <li id="li">Java applets, JavaScript and VBScript (client-side technologies)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <li id="li"> Service-oriented architectures (SOA) </li><img src="img/Service-Oriented-Architecture.png"

        <p class="p">
            Today the web is used for the networking of globally distributed IT structures. Modern IT
            and web applications are much more complex than the client-server model. With SOAs,
            business processes can be automated by the involved systems communicating with one
            another - partly without human intervention - and performing certain tasks. Examples
            include online banking, e-commerce, e-learning, online marketplaces, and business
            intelligence applications. They are known as N-tier architectures and have so far been
            used primarily in the business sector. <br><br>
            If the Web architecture was represented as an evolutionary timeline, IoT and Semantic
            Web would be the top of the development. The architectures that are used there are
            correspondingly complex. <br><br>
            The effects of different architectures are extremely diverse. From a user perspective,
            websites and web services are changing to a degree that not even developers can keep
            track of, what with hundreds of protocols, programming and scripting languages,
            frameworks and interfaces. Websites become interactive, data can be exchanged
            faster, and services interact with each other easily. From a developer’s perspective,
            web architectures are becoming more and more complex and many different
            approaches exist at the same time.
