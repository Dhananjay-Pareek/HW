    <h2 class="h2"></h2>
    <p class="p">
        Network protocols are formal standards and rules that define communication between
        two or more devices over a network. They ensure that computer network devices can
        transmit and receive data using a common language regardless of their different
        designs, hardware or infrastructures. Some of the protocols are listed below.
    </p>
    <p class="p"><br><img src="img/tcp.gif" style="float: left;" alt="">
        Transmission Control Protocol / Internet protocol (TCP/IP) TCP/IP are the two protocols
        that are used together and together they form the backbone protocol of the internet.
        They can also be used for private networks i.e. intranets and extranets. When you are
        set up with direct access to the Internet, your computer is provided with a copy of the
        TCP/IP program TCP/IP has two major components: TCP and IP.

        <li id="li">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) </li>
        <p class="p">
            TCP is a popular communication protocol which is used for communicating over a
            network. It divides any message into a series of packets that are sent from source to
            destination and there it gets reassembled at the destination.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Internet Protocol (IP) </li>
        <img src="img/ip.png" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. The IP
            addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a network until it
            reaches the destination system. An IP address is a unique identifier for a node or host
            connection on an IP network. An IP address is a 32 bit binary number usually
            represented as 4 decimal values, each representing 8 bits, in the range 0 to 255 (known
            as octets) separated by decimal points. <br>
            This is known as "dotted decimal" notation. <br>
            Example: 140.179.220.200

        <li id="li">Point-to-Point Protocol
        </li>
        <p class="p">
            PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is used for communication between two computers using
            a serial interface, mostly a personal computer connected by phone line to a server. For
            example, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) may provide you with a PPP connection so
            that the ISP's server can respond to your requests, pass them on to the Internet, and
            forward your requested Internet responses back to you. It was basically designed to
            help communication between two systems through telephone lines as it supports
            transmission of network packets over a serial point to point link. PPP is sometimes
            considered a member of the TCP/IP suite of protocol
        </p>
        <li id="li">HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
        </li>
        <p class="p">
            HTTP is designed for transferring a hypertext among two or more systems. HTML tags
            are used for creating links. These links may be in any form like text or images. HTTP is
            designed on Client-server principles which allow a client system for establishing a
            connection with the server machine for making a request. The server acknowledges the
            request initiated by the client and responds accordingly. HTTP has three important
            features. Firstly, it is connectionless. After a request is made, the client disconnects
            from the server and waits for a response. To process the request, the server has to reestablish the
            connection with the client. Secondly, HTTP is media independent. This
            means any type of data(text , images , sound , video etc.) can be sent by HTTP as long
            as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. Thirdly HTTP is
            stateless.This is because the server and the client are aware of each other only during a
            request. Afterwards, they get disconnected. Hence neither the client nor the browser
            can retain information between different requests across the web pages.
            HTTPS is abbreviated as HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is a standard protocol to
            secure the communication among two computers one using the browser and other
            fetching data from a web server. HTTP is used for transferring data between the client
            browser (request) and the web server (response) in the hypertext format, same in case
            of HTTPS except that the transferring of data is done in an encrypted format. So it can
            be said that https thwart hackers from interpretation or modification of data throughout
            the transfer of packets.

        <li id="li">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
        </li>
        <img src="img/ftp.png" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            FTP allows users to transfer files from one machine to another. Types of files may
            include program files, multimedia files, text files, and documents, etc.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP) </li>
        <p class="p">
            SMTP is designed to send and distribute outgoing EMail.SMTP is a reliable and easy to
            set up protocol. Messages either get to a recipient, or there is an error message that
            explains why that wasn't possible. One of the purposes of an SMTP is that it simplifies
            the communication of email messages between servers. It allows the server to break up
            different parts of a message into categories the other server can understand. Any email
            message has a sender, a recipient or sometimes multiple recipients - a message body,
            and usually a title heading. Once a message goes out on the internet, everything is
            turned into strings of text. This text is separated by code words or numbers that identify
            the purpose of each section of an email. SMTP provides those codes, and email server
            software is designed to interpret these codes. SMTP has a major disadvantage that it is
            relatively easy to send a message with a fake sender address. This results in the
            spread of many email-based viruses.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Post office Protocol (POP)
        </li>
        <p class="p">
            POP3 is designed for receiving incoming Emails. Post Office Protocol 3 or POP3 is the
            third version of a widespread method of receiving email which receives and holds email
            for an individual until they pick it up. SMTP has a disadvantage that if the destination
            computer is not online, mails cannot be received. So the SMTP server receives the mail
            on behalf of every host and the respective host then interacts with the SMTP server to
            retrieve messages by using a client server protocol called POP3.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Telnet </li>
        <img src="img/telnet.png" style="float: right;margin-left: 5px;" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            Telnet is the main internet protocol for creating a connection with a remote machine. It
            allows you to connect to remote computers (called remote hosts) over a TCP/IP network
            (such as the Internet). Once your telnet client establishes a connection to the remote
            host, your client becomes a virtual terminal, allowing you to communicate with the
            remote host from your computer with whatever privileges you may have been granted to
            the specific application and data on that host computer.

        <li id="li">Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
        </li><br><br><br><img src="img/irc.jfif" style="float: left;" alt="">
        <p class="p">
            IRC protocol is used for chatting. It provides chatting between a group or between two
            individuals. It was developed by JarkkoOikarinen in Finland in the late 1980s. It is based
            on the client/server model. The IRC client sends and receives messages to and from an
            IRC server. The IRC server transports the message from one client to another. The IRC
            server is linked to many other servers to form an IRC network. IRC server identifies
            every user through a unique nickname. Each user is assigned a unique channel in case
            multiple discussions are taking place.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
        </li>
        <p class="p">
            It enables the transfer of voice using a packet switched network rather than using a
            public switched telephone network. By using VOIP software, phone calls can be done
            using standard internet connection. This method of making phone calls is much cheaper
            than conventional way because the service of Telecommunication Company is not
            used.There are three different methods of VoIP service in common use today: <br>
            i.ATA -
            ATA stands for analog-to-digital converted. It is used to connect the telephone device
            to the computer. It takes the analog signals from the phone and converts them to digital
            signals. These digital signals can be transmitted over the internet. Some providers also
            are bundling ATAs free with their service. <br>
            ii. IP phones -
            IP phones appear much like an ordinary telephone or cordless phone. They are directly
            connected to the router or the LAN. They have all the hardware and software necessary
            right onboard to handle the IP call. IP Phones are sometimes calledVoIP telephones,
            SIP phones or Soft phones. <br>
            iii. Computer-to-computer -
            It is the most easy and simplest way to use VoIP. The basic hardware requirements are
            Computer, Internet, Speakers, Microphone. The only cost involved with computer - tocomputer VoIP is the
            monthly ISP fee.
