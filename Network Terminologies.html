            A network can have more than one server also. Each server has a unique
            name by which it is identified by all the nodes on the network. <br><br> Servers
            can be of two types: <br> a) Dedicated and <br> b) Non dedicated servers <br><br> Dedicated
            Servers: These are generally used on big network installations where one
            computer is reserved for the server's job. It helps all nodes access
            data, software and hardware resources. Since it does not double up as a
            workstation but only manages the network, it is known as a dedicated
            server and such types of networks are called master- slave networks. <br><br> Non
            dedicated servers: In small networks, a workstation can double up as a
            server. These servers are known as non dedicated servers. The small
            networks using such a server are known as Peer to Peer networks.

        <li id="li">Network Interface Unit (NIU):-</li>
        <p class="p-1">A network interface unit is a device that is attached
            to each of the workstations and the server which helps to establish communication
            between the server and workstations. As soon as a standalone computer becomes a
            workstation, it needs an interface to help establish connection with the network because
            without this the workstations will not be able to share network resources or
            communicate with each other. The NIC basically acts like an interpreter and is also
            known as Terminal Access Point (TAP) or Network Interface card(NIC).The NIC
            manufacturer assigns a unique physical address to each NIC card and this physical
            address is known as the MAC address.

    <h2 class="h2">Switching Techniques </h2>
    <p class="p">
        Switching techniques are used to efficiently transmit data across the network. The two
        types of switching techniques employed nowadays to provide communication between
        two computers on a network are: <br> Circuit Switching and Packet Switching Circuit
        Switching.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li id="li">Circuit switching </li>
        <p class="p">A technique in which a dedicated and complete physical
            connection is established between two nodes and through this dedicated
            communication channel, the nodes may communicate. <img src="img/packet-switching-brand.png" alt=""
                id="img">The circuit guarantees the
            full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for the duration of the
            communication session. Even if no communication is taking place in a dedicated
            circuit, that channel still remains unavailable to other users (idle channels). The
            defining example of a circuit-switched network is the early analogue telephone
            network. When a call is made from one telephone to another, switches within the
            telephone exchange create a continuous wire circuit between the two
            telephones, for as long as the call lasts. </p><br>
        <li id="li">Packet switching</li>
        <p class="p">
            A switching technique in which packets (discrete blocks of<img src="img/packet-switching.png" id="img"
                alt="">
            data of fixed size and of any content, type or structure) are routed between
            nodes over data links shared with other traffic. The term "packets" refers to the
            fact that the data stream from your computer is broken up into packets of about
            200 bytes (on average), which are then sent out onto the network. Each packet
            contains a "header" with information necessary for routing the packet from
            source to destination. Each packet in a data stream is independent. The main
            advantage of packet-switching is that the packets from many different sources
            can share a line, allowing for very efficient use of the communication medium.
            With current technology, packets are generally accepted onto the network on a
            first-come, first-served basis. If the network becomes overloaded, packets are
            delayed or discarded ("dropped"). This method of data transmission became the
            fundamental networking technology behind the internet and most Local Area
            Networks

    <h2 class="h2"> Data communication terminologies</h2>
    <p class="p">
        Let us learn about some data communication terminologies being used.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li id="li">
            Channel:
        </li>
        <p class="p">
            A communication channel is a medium that is used in the transmission
            of a message from one point to another. In simple terms we can say that it is a
            pathway over which data is transferred between remote devices. It may refer to
            the entire physical medium, such as a telephone line, optical fibre, coaxial cable
            or twisted pair wire, or, it may refer to one of the several carrier frequencies
            transmitted simultaneously within the line. Depending on their speed, we have
            three broad categories of communication channels - narrow band which is slow
            and used for telegraph lines and low speed terminals; voice band used for
            ordinary telephone communication and broadband which is fastest and is used
            for transmitting large volumes of data at high speeds.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Bandwidth:</li>
        <p class="p"><img src="img/bandwidth.png" id="img" style="width: 10%;margin-top: 2px !important;" alt="">
            In electronic communication, bandwidth refers to the range of
            frequencies available for transmission of data. It is expressed as the difference in
            Hertz(Hz) between the highest frequency and the lowest frequency. For example,
            a typical voice signal has a bandwidth of approximately 3KHz. Wider the
            bandwidth of a communication system, greater is the capacity and hence greater
            is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a period of time.
        </p><br><br>
        <li id="li">The data transfer rate (DTR)</li>
        <p class="p">
            The data transfer rate (DTR) is the amount of data in digital form that is moved
            from one place to another in a given time on a network. As studied before, the
            greater the bandwidth of a given medium, the higher is the data transfer rate.
            This can also be referred to as throughput, although data transfer rate applies
            specifically to digital data streams. Data transfer rate is often measured in bits
            per second (bps), although the unit baud , which is one bit per second is also
            used. It is commonly used to measure how fast data is transferred from one
            location to another. For example, your ISP may offer an Internet connection with
            a maximum data transfer rate of 4Mbps.
