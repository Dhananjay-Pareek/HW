        On the basis of geographical span, the network can be broadly categorized as PAN,
        LAN, MAN, and WAN.

            A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among
            computers and devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in
            a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners,
            and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The
            reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.

        <p class="p"><img src="img/lan.jpg" alt="" id="img" style="width: 20%;margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Local Area networks (LAN) are private networks and can span a radius of up to 1 Km.
            They are generally established within a building or campus.LANs operate at a speed in
            the range 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps.

        <li id="li">Metropolitan Area Network</li>
        <p class="p"><img src="img/Metropolitan-Area-Network.png" id="img" style="width: 20%;" alt="">
            Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) may be owned by a single organization or by many
            individuals or organizations. These networks are used to establish links within a city,
            and span an area of radius up to 50 Km. MANs facilitate sharing of resources by
            connecting various local area networks For example, a cable television network within a
            city.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Wide Area Network</li>
        <p class="p">
            Wide Area Network (WAN) spans about 1000 Km. They are used for long distance
            communication and are well suited for connecting remote areas. They establish links
            within a country or continent. A WAN may be owned and managed by several
            organizations. It connects various local and metropolitan area networks.

    <h2 class="h2">Transmission Medium </h2>
    <p class="p">
        A transmission medium refers to the channel of transmission through which data
        transmitted from one node to another in the form of signal. A signal encodes the data in
        a form suitable for transmission on the medium. A medium is characterized by its
        bandwidth defining the information carrying capacity of the medium. Common meth
        of Internet access by users include dial
        circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi
        cellular telephone technology (e.g. 3G, 4G).A transmission medium may belong to
        of the following two categories: <br><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id="li">Guided Medium:</li>
        <p class="p">
            The term refers to physical conductors such as twisted pairs,
            coaxial cable, and fiber optics. In twisted pair and coaxial cable, the signal travels
            as voltage and current signal whereas in optical fibre,
            light.
        </p>
        <li id="li">Unguided Medium:</li>
        <p class="p">
            The unguided medium uses electro
            not require a physical conductor. Examples of unguided medium include
            microwave, radio wave,infrared.
